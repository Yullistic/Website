    </div>
<p> I'm Julianne P. Bullen, a computer engineering student. I'm a kind and approachable person, yet I can be shy around new people. 
    I enjoy making people laugh since I think that laughter is the best medicine. I have a wild imagination and enjoy coming up with
    my own ideas because I can convey my ideas more clearly. I enjoy drawing, although my skills are still lacking. I prefer a tidy 
    and ordered workplace since it makes it easier for me to concentrate on my studies or do my schoolwork.
</p>
<p>
My guiding concept for living my life is to always be at peace with myself,  cherish the present, connect with my loved ones and 
close friends, be healthy, partake in activities I find enjoyable, and never stop learning and growing as a person.
</p>
<p>
I am different from others because I have my own likes and dislikes , I have my own experience  with different people  and I 
have my own perspective in life . I have my own hummer that people can't understand. I make my own decisions and choices very 
differently from most others . I can be similar to others in terms of culture and nationality.
</p>

<p> My best performance was in elementary school. In my opinion, My parents know how much I love art and how proud I am that they 
    recognize my talent by giving me the “Best in arts” award. Even though it was only a tiny award , my parents nevertheless expressed 
    their happiness for me. 
</p>

<p>  My life's ambition is to complete college and get a well-paying profession. I want to provide for my family so they won't have any 
    trouble making ends meet. With my closest friends, I wish to travel the world and explore other countries, especially Japan. I want 
    to be a family man with a home of my own. In my bedroom, I want to build up a gaming area and make a career out of it.
